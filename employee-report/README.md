# Employee Report

Youâ€™re building an employee management system of a local grocery store. 

The shop-owner wants to open the shop on Sunday and due to legal restrictions 
employees younger than 18 years are not allowed to work Sundays.

The employee asks for a reporting feature so she can schedule work shifts.

All employees are already stored somewhere and have the following properties:

 - name: string (the name of the employee)
 - age: number (the age in years of the employee)

```
employees: List[Employee]= [
 Employee(name="max", age=17),
 Employee(name="Sepp", age=18),
 Employee(name="Nina", age=15),
 Employee(name="mike", age=51),     
]
```

## Rules

Start with the first user-story and write at least one test for every requirement.

Try not to look on future requirements upfront and follow the TDD-Cycle strictly.

 - As shop owner I want to view a list of all employees who are 18 years or older so that I know who is allowed to work on Sundays.
 - As shop owner I want the list of employees to be sorted by their name, so I can find employees easier.
 - As shop owner I want the list of employees to be capitalized, so I can read it better.
 - As shop owner I want the employees to be sorted by their names descending instead of ascending.
