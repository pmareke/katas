# Introduction

Write a function that takes positive integers and outputs their string representation.

Your function should comply with the following additional rules:

 - If the number is a multiple of three, return the string "Fizz".
 - If the number is a multiple of five, return the string "Buzz".
 - If the number is a multiple of both three and five, return the string "FizzBuzz".

For example, given the numbers from 1 to 15 in order, the function would return:

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```
