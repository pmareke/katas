# Goal

Unit test the printCurrentDate function.

1. Test coupled code
2. Test the code with doubles from a library.
3. Test the code with doubles created by you.

# Code to test
```python
    class PrintDate:
        def print_current_date(self):
            print(datetime.today())
```

# Learnings

- How to use Stubs and Spies to generate the doubles.
- How to build a Mock and Stub manually.
