# Tiered pricing

## User story

Companies want to get Codely subscriptions for their
employees.

We need to calculate the total price of the subscription
given the number of subscription that a company
wants to purchase.

The annual unit price of the subscription depends on the
volume of the subscriptions as shown in the following
table:

| Range | Unit price |
|------:|-----------:|
|   1-2 |      299 € |
|  3-10 |      239 € |
| 11-25 |      219 € |
| 26-50 |      199 € |
|   51+ |      149 € |

Here are some examples that can guide you during the
development process:

| Subscriptions | Unit price | Total |
|--------------:|-----------:|------:|
| 1             |      299 € | 299 €  |
