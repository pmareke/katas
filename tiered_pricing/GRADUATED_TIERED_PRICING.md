A more advanced variation of the [Tiered Pricing](./TIERED_PRICING.md) exercise.

## User story

Companies want to get Codely subscriptions for their
employees.

We need to calculate the total price of the subscription
given the number of subscription that a company
wants to purchase.

Each subscription has a different unit price, depending
on the tier it belongs to:

| Range | Unit price |
|------:|-----------:|
|   1-2 |      299 € |
|  3-10 |      239 € |
| 11-25 |      219 € |
| 26-50 |      199 € |
|   51+ |      149 € |

For example, if the company wants 3 subscription,
the price of each subscription would be:

| subscription # | Price |
|---------------:|------:|
|              1 | 299 € |
|              2 | 299 € |
|              3 | 239 € |
|      **Total** | 837 € |

Here are some examples that can guide you during the
development process:

| Subscriptions | Unit price | Total   |
|--------------:|-----------:|--------:|
| 1             |      299 € |   299 € |
| 2             |      299 € |   598 € |
